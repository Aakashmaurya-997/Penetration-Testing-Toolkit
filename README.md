**🏢 COMPANY**: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS PVT. LTD

**👤 NAME**: AAKASH JAYDEV MAURYA

**🆔 INTERN ID**: CT04WS67

**🌐 DOMAIN**: CYBER SECURITY & ETHICAL HACKING

**🕓 DURATION**: 4 WEEKS

**👨‍🏫 MENTOR**: NEELA SANTOSH KUMAR

## 📜 DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK

---

### 🔹 Introduction

Penetration testing tools help cybersecurity professionals identify vulnerabilities in systems before real hackers can exploit them.  
As part of this internship task, a **Penetration Testing Toolkit** was created in **Python** containing two modules:

- **Port Scanner**
- **Password Brute Forcer**

Both modules are fundamental in the preliminary information gathering (reconnaissance) phases of ethical hacking.

---

### 🔹 Working Principle

- **Port Scanner**:  
  Scans a target IP address across a range of ports to identify which ports are open. Open ports can reveal services running and possible attack surfaces.

- **Password Brute Forcer**:  
  Attempts multiple passwords on a dummy login system, simulating how brute-force attacks work.

---

### 🔹 Key Features

- **Fast Socket-Based Port Scanning**: Efficiently checks 1000+ ports in seconds.
- **Demo Brute-Force Module**: Tests a predefined list of common passwords.
- **CLI Based Modular Structure**: The toolkit offers an interactive command-line menu to select the module.

---

### 🔹 Importance

Port scanning is the first step in any real-world cyber attack. Knowing which ports are open can reveal everything about an organization’s defenses.  
Similarly, brute-forcing remains a basic but effective way to breach accounts if users select weak passwords.

---

### 🔹 Use Cases

- Scanning personal devices to ensure no unnecessary open ports exist.
- Educating about the dangers of using simple or common passwords.
- Training exercises in ethical hacking courses.

---

### 🔹 Technologies Used

- Python
- Socket Programming

---

### 🔹 Future Enhancements

- Add multi-threading to speed up scanning.
- Support UDP port scanning.
- Implement dictionary attacks using external password lists.

---

### 🔹 Conclusion

This **Penetration Testing Toolkit** introduces basic but critical cybersecurity techniques that professionals use daily.  
It demonstrates that even seemingly simple tools can expose significant security weaknesses when applied intelligently.
