*DOMAIN*: CYBER SECURITY & ETHICAL HACKING 

*DURATION*: 4 WEEKS

*MENTOR*: NEELA SANTOSH KUMAR

## DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK

Introduction:
Penetration testing tools help cybersecurity professionals identify vulnerabilities in systems before real hackers can exploit them. As part of this internship task, a Penetration Testing Toolkit was created in Python containing two modules:

Port Scanner

Password Brute Forcer

Both modules are fundamental in preliminary information gathering (reconnaissance) phases of ethical hacking.

Working Principle:

Port Scanner:
Scans a target IP address across a range of ports to identify which ports are open. Open ports can reveal services running and possible attack surfaces.

Password Brute Forcer:
Attempts multiple passwords on a dummy login system, simulating how brute-force attacks work.

Key Features:

Fast Socket-Based Port Scanning:
Efficiently checks 1000+ ports in seconds.

Demo Brute-Force Module:
Tests a predefined list of common passwords.

CLI Based Modular Structure:
The toolkit offers an interactive command-line menu to select the module.

Importance:
Port scanning is the first step in any real-world cyber attack. Knowing which ports are open can reveal everything about an organization’s defenses. Similarly, brute-forcing remains a basic but effective way to breach accounts if users select weak passwords.

Use Cases:

Scanning personal devices to ensure no unnecessary open ports exist.

Educating about the dangers of using simple or common passwords.

Training exercises in ethical hacking courses.

Technologies Used:

Python

Socket Programming

Future Enhancements:

Add multi-threading to speed up scanning.

Support UDP port scanning.

Implement dictionary attacks using external password lists.

Conclusion:
This Penetration Testing Toolkit introduces basic but critical cybersecurity techniques that professionals use daily. It demonstrates that even seemingly simple tools can expose significant security weaknesses when applied intelligently.
